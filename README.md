Red Black Trees : Time Complexity Analysis : Search -> O(log n) Insert -> O(log n) Delete -> O(log n)

Applications : 
    1. Most of the self-balancing BST library functions like map and set in C++ use Red-Black Tree.
    2. It is used to implement CPU Scheduling Linux. 
    3. They are used in the K-mean clustering algorithm for reducing time complexity.
    4. MySQL also uses the Red-Black tree for indexes on tables.
Minimum Spanning Trees : Time Complexity Analysis : O(V^2) ,where V is the no of vertices in graph

Applications :
    1. Network Designing.
    2. Approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems.
    3. Cluster Analysis.
    4. LDPC codes for error Correction.
Sorting : Time and Space Complexity Analysis : Bubble Sort : O(n^2) for worst and average case O(n) for best case Selection Sort : O(n^2) Time Complexity for all cases
Insertion Sort : O(n) for best case O(n^2) for worst and average case Quick Sort : O(nlog n) for best and average case O(n^2) for worst case Merge Sort : O(nlog n) for all cases

Advantages :
    Bubble Sort : 
        1. Bubble sort is often used to introduce the concept of a sorting algorithm. 
        2. In computer graphics it is popular for its capability to detect a very small error (like swap of just two elements) in almost-sorted arrays and fix it with just linear complexity (2n).
    Selection Sort :
        1. This can be important if writes are significantly more expensive than reads, such as with EEPROM or Flash memory, where every write lessens the lifespan of the memory.
        2. Can be useful when memory write is a costly operation.
    Insertion Sort :
        1.  Insertion sort is used when number of elements is small. 
        2. It can also be useful when input array is almost sorted, only few elements are misplaced in complete big array.
    Quick Sort :
        1. The sorting algorithm is used for information searching.
        2. Quicksort is a cache-friendly algorithm as it has a good locality of reference when used for arrays.
        3. It is used in operational research and event-driven simulation.
    Merge Sort :
        1. Merge Sort is useful for sorting linked lists in O(n Log n) time.
        2. It can be implemented without extra space for linked lists.
        3. It is used for counting inversions in a list.
        4. It is used in external sorting.
